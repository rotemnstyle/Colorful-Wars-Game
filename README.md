# Colorful-Wars-Game
A colorful code wars game which includes CSS and an Vanilla JavaScript.
This game is a fun project which decided for following my heart and fullfill myself to become a Front End Developer and to improve my
JavaScript skills. 

Developed and designed with the songs Eye of the Tiger and Don't Stop Believin'.
